    From chem geek atÂ https://www.troublefreepool.com/threads/19688-CSI-formula?p=166165&viewfull=1#post166165:

    A very close approximation to the accurate Calcite Saturation Index uses the following formulas (I do refer to these in that post, but in the spreadsheet itself, not in the text of the post):

    LSI = pH - 6.9395 + log(ppm CH) + log(ppm CarbAlk) - 2.56*sqrt(I)/(1+1.65*sqrt(I)) - 1412.5/(oC+273.15)

    I = (1.5*(ppm CH)+(ppm TA))/50045 + (extra NaCl ppm)/58440

    extra NaCl ppm = Salt - 1.168*(ppm CH), but if <0 then use 0

    ppm CarbAlk = (ppm TA) - 0.38772*(ppm CYA)/(1+10^(6.83-pH)) - 4.63*(ppm Borates)/(1+10^(9.11-pH))Â 


    The "log" are logarithms to the base 10 (i.e. they aren't "ln"). So start with the bottom formula and work your way up. So first calculate CarbAlk using TA and CYA.
    Then calculate the extra salt via the TDS, CH, CarbAlk just calculated and CYA. Then calculate the "I" which is the ionic strength using the CH, TA and
    extra NaCl (salt) that was calculated. Finally, the LSI is computed.

    Obviously, the above is best done online, or in a spreadsheet, or in a program. Michael Smith can add this to BleachCalc and you can add this to your online calculations.
    It will be close to, but not the same as, the Langelier Saturation Index (LSI), but will actually be more accurate. It seems to be virtually the same as the Taylor Watergram
    wheel except at very high temperatures above 120F and even then the error is small. You'll need to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius but that's just
    oC = 5*(oF - 32)/9. The LSI as used by the pool industry is actually incorrect and uses logarithms for the temperature and TDS portions of the computation when they should
    have used the formulas I showed above, but then they were trying to simplify things though the temperature formula isn't complicated so I'm not sure why they went with
    logarithms for that except to "appear" consistent with all factors except for pH (which is already a logarithm).
